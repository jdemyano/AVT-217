<h1>Brief for Personal Website</h1>

	<h2>Objective</h2>

	</ul>
	
	<h2>Research</h2>
	<p>
		To sell my skills as a producer, most companies do not require a portfolio. In fact, they are primarily interested in using LinkedIn and information on a resume to make hiring decisions. If I would like to showcase how well-rounded I am with game development, then having a portfolio site is one of the best ways to accomplish this.
